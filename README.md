# Deep Neural Networks as Optimal Control problems

Project about developing new algorithms for Deep Neural Networks by interpreting them as a discretization of a optimal control problem subject to an ordinary differential equation constraint.
Code from the article [Deep Neural Networks as Optimal Control Problems](https://proceedings.sbmac.org.br/sbmac/article/view/4009).
